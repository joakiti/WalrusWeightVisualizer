# WalrusWeightVisualizer

To run this project, clone the repository, and have NodeJS installed (You can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/)

Standing in the root of the repository, run "npx webpack-dev-server --mode development" from any bash terminal.

Remember to run npm install, and, remember that for the computation to run you must click "start" which is slightly hidden at the bottom of the weight panel.

The site should now be running on localhost:3000
